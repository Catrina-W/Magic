        <p>Way back when Devon was a young middle-schooler, he was inspired by a friend who taught him a few magic tricks and bought his first deck of playing cards. Now, after years of practice and fine-tuning, Devon has built up his own professional repetoire and enjoys inspiring other magician-to-be's wherever he performs.</p>

        <p>Based in Columbus, Ohio, Devon has shared the art of magic all across the Buckeye State from local farmers markets, weddings, corporate businesses, to K-12 school events. Known for his crowd work, he pulls in audiences from all age groups as he incorporates different personalities into his performances.</p>
            
        <p>Interested in having Devon perform at your event?  Feel free to reach out to learn more about his availability, flexible rates, and be sure to ask about his collection of over 100 decks of playing cards.</p>
